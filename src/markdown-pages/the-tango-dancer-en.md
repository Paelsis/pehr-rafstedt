I started to dance tango just before i turned 50 - I knew imideately that I was "home". I was where I wanted to be. Argentinian tango, is a improvised couple dance, with no fixed pattern or sequences. When you learn to dance, you learn some steps and sequenses, but when you become a social dancer, you "forget" all about that, and start to create you own dance together with your partner. When I started to dance, and was in dispair my friend Joe said to me - "remember the simplest tango is an embrace - just dance the way you play blues....simple".  Every new dance is a new creation. For me!  Its about passion, joy, lust, focus, creativity, connection, curiosity, oportunity, sexuality - to be in the presence. Tango takes me to places my body and soul are longing for - places, I cant reach by myselve.  I like to think, I dance the way I paint and vice versa.
